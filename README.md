**Project Title:**
Measuring COVID-19â€™s impact on CA sub-populations

**Project Description/Outline:**
News outlets have reported that various demographic subgroups have been more adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than others. Looking at both Los Angeles County and the State of California as a whole, we seek to parse data to learn if the reports are supported by the numbers.

**Questions:**
- In Los Angeles County, did some race/ethnicity groups experience a disproportionately higher percent of deaths than others? 
- In California, of the youth (0-17 yo), working age (18-65 yo), and retirement age (65+ yo) cohorts, was any particular age group disproportionately affected by COVID-19?
- In California, have rural counties fared better or worse during the pandemic than urban counties?
